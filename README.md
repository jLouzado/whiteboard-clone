## Setup

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

## Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Architecture

Loosely based on the Elm Architecture:

- Canvas is handled natively, no VDom or anything
- The tools on the left are rendered and managed with Snabbdom, mostly for DX sake
  - this section of the app are mostly pure functions and the `updates` are TDD'd
- As far as the app is concerned state is immutable, it's just updated by the dispatcher in index.js
  - for now it's just standard objects for the state since it's relatively flat,
  - as the application gets more complex some kind of immutability solution might need to be brought in.
- The Writing "Instruments" are initialized in the state, so that `onDraw` the actual instrument being used is abstracted away.

## Challenges

- I think the most challenging requirement was to only have one highlighter-stroke drawn at a time.
- As you can see, I tried 3 different implementations to get it working
  - finally I realized I needed to clear the canvas before redrawing it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

## Potential Improvements

- With some benchmarks I'd like to see the difference it would make if the `mousemove` listener weren't running all the time
- extract all the side-effects out into an interpreter rather than being all mixed-in
- the highlighter UX is not as clean as I'd like, would need to look into it more to see how it can be made smoother
